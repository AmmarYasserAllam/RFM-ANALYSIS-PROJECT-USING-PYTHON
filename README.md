# Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a customer segmentation analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, a powerful marketing technique to group customers based on their behavior and value. The goal of the analysis is to identify distinct customer segments and gain valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered transactional data containing customer IDs, purchase dates, and transaction amounts.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and processed the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. **RFM Calculation:** Calculated the RFM metrics for each customer - Recency (time since last purchase), Frequency (number of purchases), and Monetary (total spending).
4. **RFM Scoring:** Assigned scores to each RFM metric using quantiles or predefined bins.
5. **RFM Segmentation:** Combined the RFM scores to create a unique RFM segment for each customer.
6. **Customer Segmentation:** Grouped customers into different segments based on their RFM scores, resulting in distinct customer segments.

## Conclusion

The RFM-based customer segmentation provided valuable insights into customer behavior and allowed the creation of targeted marketing strategies for different customer groups. Leveraging these segments, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer retention, and maximize revenue.
